# Perspective Todo List

 - [ ] Resource Pack Documentation  
 - [ ] LegacyFabric Backport (it may not have all perspective features)  
 - [x] Create Textured Entity `default` json files.  
 - [ ] API for Flipping/Scaling Players (for developer use but with a config option for custom api url).  
 - [x] Add April Fools Prank (added but will use api once implemented)
 - [ ] Fix #3 by renaming mixins namespace. Unfortunately, [Perspective Mod Redux](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/perspective-mod-redux) uses "perspective" for mixins namespace instead of using the same as their mod namespace "perspectivemod".
