With 1.21 coming out soon, Perspective 1.3 will now be developed for 1.21. This release of Perspective gives 1.20.5/6 a more stable build.  
For the latest 1.3 build for 1.20.5/6 use [1.3.0-alpha.6](https://modrinth.com/mod/mclegoman-perspective/version/1.3.0-alpha.6+1.20.5-6).  

## Changelog  
- Ported `1.2.2.release.1` to 1.20.6.  
- Backported Perspective Config Splash Texts from `1.3.0-alpha.6`.    
- Updated Super Secret Settings.  
  - Vanilla shaders that aren't used by mobs will now be in Luminance's Super Secret Settings resource pack.  

## 1.3 Development  
`1.3.0-alpha.7` will change a lot with shader rendering, and will take some time for me to work on. I will release a (VERY UNPOLISHED/UNSTABLE) pre-build before my break on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/vjbvjpFFPm).
