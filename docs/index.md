**Welcome to the Perspective Documentation.**  
This page will hopefully contain all the information you need to use Perspective in your own projects.  

Perspective is a Minecraft mod developed for Fabric/Quilt. It allows players to zoom, change and hold perspectives, have custom textures on named/random entities, take panoramic screenshots, and use super secret settings!  

Visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/mclegoman-perspective) or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/perspective) to download the mod.
