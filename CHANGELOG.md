## Perspective 1.2.0 Release Candidate 1  
Perspective 1.2.0 will be released some time next week if no bugs are found.  

**Hosting Update:** *1.2.0-release.1 will be the final version to be released on Curseforge.*  
More information on this change will be posted as we get closer to 1.2.0-release.1.  

### Changelog  
- Added `skipDisableScreenModeWhenWorldNull` check to shader cycling/toggling.  
  - This doesn't currently affect functionality as keybindings don't get checked when you are not in a world.
