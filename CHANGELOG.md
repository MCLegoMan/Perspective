## DEVELOPERS NOTE  
QuiltMC should work on this release. I've had a look over for bugs on both Quilt and Fabric and haven't found anymore. I'll release 1.1.0 tomorrow if no more bugs are found.  

## CHANGELOG  
 - Removed accesswidener, PerspectiveScreenshotRecorder now requires a filename.  
 - QuiltMC and FabricMC have both been tested for this version, and no more bugs have been found with any of Perspectives features.  

### Found a bug?  
You can report any bugs or issues you encounter with Perspective on our [Issues](https://github.com/MCLegoMan/Perspective/issues) page.
