## [1.20.x] Perspective 1.1.0-beta.1  
 - Added Development Warning Screen. Auto-Detects weather the current version is a development build.  
 - Updated Hold Perspective to go back to the previous perspective.  
 - Added middle mouse click to reset zoom whilst zooming.  
 - Added Customizable Default Config. (Documentation coming soon)  
 - Added April Fools' Prank.  
 - Added Textured Entity  
 - Updated Super Secret Settings to have two different modes. (default)"Game" and "Screen". This fixes the issue where pressing F4 or cycling perspectives via the vanilla keybinding would remove the shader. Note: Some shaders aren't as nice to use on "Screen" mode.  
 - Removed Cycle Perspective. This was only added due to the vanilla keybinding removing the shader.
 - Removed Increase/Decrease zoom level keybindings.
 - Added Take Panorama Screenshot. This is not compatible with Sodium.  
 - You can now close the config screens by pressing ESC.  
 - Updated Config Version to 3.  

**More Info**  
Due to the amount of testing whilst developing this version, I have decided to release this as a BETA instead of an ALPHA.  
Note, as this is a development build, you may experience some bugs/issues.  
Please report any bugs you find to Perspective's [Issues](https://github.com/MCLegoMan/Perspective/issues) page with any information you have.
