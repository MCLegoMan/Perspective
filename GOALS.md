## **Current Goals for Perspective:**  
- Test and Fix **_every_** vanilla textured entity.

- Documentation on the [Perspective Wiki](https://mclegoman.com/Perspective)  

#### **Known incompatible textured entities:**  
- `minecraft:ender_dragon` (attempted to fix without success, also can't be named anyway)
