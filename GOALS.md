## **Current Goals for Perspective:**  
- **1.3.0**  
  - Test and Fix **_every_** vanilla textured entity.  
  - Shader Selection Screen will now open when selecting shaders using the config screen.
- Documentation on the [Perspective Wiki](https://mclegoman.com/Perspective)  
- Fix Depth Shaders rendering over the players hand. (This one may be a hard one to fix - config option for custom hand renderer maybe?)
- Fix Panorama Screenshot compatibility with iris/canvas/fabulous. (unlikely to be fixed anytime soon, maybe custom screenshotting?)  

#### **Known incompatible textured entities:**  
- `minecraft:ender_dragon` (attempted to fix without success, also can't be named anyway)
